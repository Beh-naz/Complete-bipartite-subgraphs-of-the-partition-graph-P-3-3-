# Complete-bipartite-subgraphs-of-the-partition-graph-P(3^3)

- Utilized mathematical proofs to construct the $\mathcal{P}(3^3)$ partition graph.
- Categorized vertex pairs into 5 equivalent clusters.
- Identified complete bipartite subgraphs.
- Constructed maximal simplicies for the edge box complex of the graph.
