# Complete Bipartite Subgraphs of the Partition Graph P(3^3).

- Utilized mathematical proofs to construct the $\mathcal{P}(3^3)$ partition graph.
- Categorized vertex pairs into 5 equivalent clusters.
- Identified complete bipartite subgraphs.
- Constructed maximal simplicies for the edge box complex of the graph.

## Results
The result files are downloadable from [Results](https://github.com/Beh-naz/Complete-bipartite-subgraphs-of-the-partition-graph-P-3-3-/blob/main/Results.zip) folder:
- Five clusters of vertex pairs are provided in the uploaded Excel files, categorized by different types defined in the program.
- Excel files named with different simplicies contain all the simplicies of the box complex of the graph $\mathcal{P}(3^3)$ categorized into five different clusters. Note that these simplicies are the same as the complete bipartite subgraphs of $\mathcal{P}(3^3)$.
- Additionally, there are files containing all the vertices and edges of the $\mathcal{P}(3^3)$ graph.
